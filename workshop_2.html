<h2>Introduction: Statistics for a Changing Climate</h2>
<p>Welcome to our second workshop using R this semester. Meeting all of
you has been fun, and feedback has been positive so far. The discussions
we had over our first practical sessions guided this workshop. Active
participation really helps us tailor what we teach to suit your
interests and goals, so please keep coming along and talking with
us!</p>
<div id="section-recap-of-last-week" class="section level3">
<h3>Recap of last week</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://kga320-utas.shinyapps.io/workshop_1/">workshop
1</a>, we provided an introduction/refresher on the basics of R. We
covered the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Wrangling</strong>: Preparing data for analysis using
CSV files and data dictionaries.</li>
<li><strong>Basic R Operations</strong>: Loading data with
<code>read.csv()</code>, examining structure with
<code>str()</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Statistics</strong>: Calculating mean, median, and
standard deviation with <code>mean()</code>, <code>median()</code>, and
<code>sd()</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization</strong>: Using <code>ggplot</code> and
the “grammar of graphics” for effective plots.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is well worth returning to workshop 1 if you need to refresh your
memory. This workshop builds on the basics introduced last week, so a
good grasp of the basics will be beneficial.</p>
<p>The following code block will perform the set-up required for this
workshop, using everything we learned from workshop 1:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Setup R environment
library(tidyverse) # Includes ggplot2 and dplyr.

barossa_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/barossa_1951-2014.csv&quot;)

# Observational data
north_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/monsoonal_north_burdekin_1951-2014.csv&quot;)
eastcoast_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/east_coast_north_coast_1951-2014.csv&quot;)
murray_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/murray_basin_riverina_1951-2014.csv&quot;)
tas_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/southern_slopes_south_1951-2014.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Remember this final code block from last week’s exercises? We tried
creating a scatter plot of daily maximum temperatures over time, and the
result isn’t useful at all!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Scatter plot of tasmax over time.</code></pre>
<p>This week, we’ll show you how to arrange data sets for better
analysis of change in time.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-preparing-data-for-better-analysis"
class="section level3">
<h3>Preparing data for better analysis</h3>
<p>The clearest problem with the data available as it stands is its
<strong>resolution</strong>. Having a measurement of weather every day
is versatile but complicated. We are dealing with a spinning planet
moving around the sun. With that comes cycles and feedback loops. Some
we know intuitively, such as the seasons. Some might seem more elusive,
like the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.</p>
<p>Understanding periodic processes is foundational to climate science.
For this course, we’ll use simple methods of grouping and averaging to
remove as much periodicity as possible. We will need to learn some new
functions and techniques to do this.</p>
<p>First, we can use the function <code>cut</code> to create a factor
that groups data by decade with a new column. We can then use this new
column as a factor when creating plots or conducting statistics. Let’s
create a new data frame, <code>barossa_data_decadal</code> using
<code>cut</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Cut data by year.</code></pre>
<p>Another way to manipulate data frames is to use another great <a
href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> package -
<strong>dplyr</strong>. dplyr is a package that provides functions for
manipulating data frames by stringing together commands using
<strong>pipes</strong>. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create a data set that averages tasmax, tasmin, and pr for every year in barossa_data.</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>barossa_yearly &lt;- barossa_data %&gt;%</code>
<ul>
<li>Create a new data frame called <code>barossa_yearly</code> that is
constructed from <code>barossa_data</code>.</li>
<li><code>%&gt;%</code> is a <strong>pipe</strong>.
<code>barossa_data</code> will be pushed through into the next function
for processing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>group_by(year) %&gt;%</code>
<ul>
<li>Group data by year and pipe it through to the next function. This
will give us the columns to which the new columns will be matched.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>summarize</code>
<ul>
<li>Creates new columns called <code>mean_tasmax</code>,
<code>mean_tasmin</code>, and <code>mean_pr</code> that are calculated
to be the means of each respective function for every year.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Using <code>dplyr</code> gives endless ways to interpret your data.
For example, you could look at seasonal cycles and how they have changed
by averaging over months and grouping across decades. Or, you could
count the number of days exceeding a certain temperature yearly. This is
where you can start asking key questions for your report!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Like ggplot, dplyr also has a <a
href="https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-transformation.pdf">cheat
sheet</a>. Last week, it was noted that the cheatsheets can be messy.
Use them as a guide as to what you can do, and use Google or ask us if
you need further guidance.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="section-comparative-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparative analysis</h3>
<p>Now that we can group data over time periods of our choosing, we can
undertake comparative analysis. Let’s first see what’s happening
visually. Below we will make a violin plot of each decade, using the
data frame we constructed with <code>cut</code> in the previous
section:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create violin plots of decadal variation in maximum temperature.</code></pre>
<div id="section-statistical-comparisons" class="section level4">
<h4>Statistical comparisons</h4>
<p>We can see some visual differences, but eyes are not enough. We need
to conduct a statistical test to show that there is a meaningful
difference between time periods. A simple measure can be found with a
<strong>t-test</strong>. A t-test compares the difference between means
for two groups. This test assumes that each group follows a
<strong>normal distribution</strong> or a bell curve shape.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Conduct a t-test comparing decades.</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the test gives a few outputs. Let’s go through the
key ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>t</code> measures the difference between the means, accounting
for standard error. In this case, we have <code>t = 2.5505</code>.
Values above 2 for large datasets are generally considered
significant.</li>
<li><code>p-value</code> is the probability that the test has found a
significant difference. We reject a <strong>null hypothesis</strong>
that the means are equal if <span
class="math inline">\(p&lt;0.05\)</span>. Here, we have
<code>p-value = 0.02</code>, so we have strong evidence to suggest that
the means of the two groups are different.</li>
<li><code>95 percent confidence interval</code> provides an interval of
the difference between the means of the two groups. In this case, the
interval is given to be <code>-5.59 -0.57</code>, so we can be 95% sure
that the 2010s are between 5 and 0.5 degrees warmer than the 1950s.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>🤔 <strong>Are the assumptions made for conducting a t-test valid for
the data collected?</strong></p>
<p>Consider the temperature distribution histograms you made last week.
Did they look like normal distributions? This is worth considering, but
a t-test works well for now.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="section-correlation-analysis" class="section level4">
<h4>Correlation analysis</h4>
<p>As we move further into statistical analysis, we must consider
<strong>correlation</strong>. Correlation measures how much two
variables are related to each other. It is <em>not</em> a measure of
whether one variable has influence over the other. Correlation does not
equal causation!</p>
<p>In R, we can find a correlation using the <code>cor</code> function.
<code>cor</code> takes two variables and finds a coefficient that takes
on values between 1 and -1, with a coefficient of 0 indicating no
correlation, a positive coefficient indicating both variables are
increasing relative to each other, and a negative coefficient indicating
the increase of one variable is associated with the decrease of the
other. Let’s find the correlations between the variables in
<code>barossa_data</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Correlation between variables</code></pre>
<p>We can see that <code>tasmax</code> and <code>tasmin</code> are
strongly correlated. This makes sense; they are both measures of
temperature for a day. <code>tasmax</code> and <code>pr</code> show a
small correlation, suggesting that days with higher heat are more likely
to come with rain in the Barossa Valley.</p>
<p>We can show this correlation with simple scatter graphs of the
compared variables:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Scatter plot of pr ~ tasmax</code></pre>
<p>Correlation will be an important measure to consider as we analyse
the complete change of variables over time by building a <strong>linear
model</strong>. Variables that are strongly correlated can reduce the
effectiveness of linear models. There’s nothing to worry about yet, but
keep it in mind! ### Advanced visualisations</p>
<p>We won’t fully construct and analyse linear models this week but can
visualise them. <code>ggplot</code> provides a means to simply visualise
a linear relationship with <code>geom_smooth</code>. Last week, this
would not have been useful; the complete dataset was far too messy. Now
that we have <code>barossa_yearly</code>, we can finally make useful
time series figures. Let’s construct one for <code>tasmax</code> over
the observation period:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Scatter plot with regression line?</code></pre>
<p>We can see a clear change over time; when we construct complete
linear models, we will back up the visuals with a p-value, but this is a
good start!</p>

<h2>Workshop: Comparative Analysis</h2>
<div id="section-summary-of-introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary of introduction</h3>
<p>You should now feel ready to go deeper with your climate data! Here’s
a summary of the key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Preparation</strong>: Using functions like
<code>cut</code> and those provided in dplyr to simplify high-resolution
data.</li>
<li><strong>Comparative Analysis</strong>: Plotting different time
periods, and comparing them with t-tests.</li>
<li><strong>Correlation</strong>: Calculating correlation between
variables with <code>cor</code> and visualising them with scatter
plots.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Visualisations</strong>: Using
<code>geom_smooth</code> to visualise trends in a time series.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-testing-your-knowledge" class="section level3">
<h3>Testing your knowledge</h3>
<p>Almost time to code! First, another quick quiz. Good luck!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># What is the correct order of operations to summarise barossa_data by averages for each decade?</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Which of the following code blocks could be used to create a data frame with the mean for each month in barossa_data?</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># A t-test comparing variables A and B has estimated a 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean to be [-0.53, 1.34], with a p-value of 0.3. What is a suitable conclusion?</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Variables i and j have a correlation coefficient of 0.9. If you plotted i and j on a scatter plot, how would you expect the points to generally trend?</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Which dplyr function would correctly filter barossa_data for all values of tasmax above a threshold of 30?</code></pre>
<p>There are lots of questions here with dplyr and pipes. If you get
them correct, give yourself a pat on the back! Try using the correct
code provided in these examples as part of the exercises below. ###
Exercises</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔥 <strong>Important:</strong> You cannot save your work on this
webpage. If you create something you want to keep, save it to your
computer!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>📊 <strong>Assessment Portfolio Task A</strong>: The first assessment
task for these workshops is still some time away, but the sooner you
start, the better! This week, you should consider how you might
structure your data to highlight climate impacts on your region.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="section-correlation-between-variables" class="section level4">
<h4>Correlation between variables</h4>
<p>It’s your turn! First, let’s compare the variables in your region
using <code>cor</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Find the correlation coefficients for your region&#39;s climate variables.</code></pre>
<p>These results will come into play for future analysis. Would you
choose one variable over another to look into a certain question? Does
correlation have an impact on any models you might want to
construct?</p>
</div>
<div id="section-comparing-across-time-periods" class="section level4">
<h4>Comparing across time periods</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>🔎 <strong>For your report</strong>: You will make a few comparisons
and factors here. It’s up to you to consider the best way to manipulate
your data to suit the climate story you want to tell. If you feel lost,
list a few good questions that you think you could answer with
temperature and precipitation measurements, and talk to us about how
they could be answered with statistics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we can try factoring your data into decades using
<code>cut</code>. Check that this has worked, and then create violin
plots for each decade. If particular decades look worth comparing,
conduct a t-test to measure the difference. Remember to make notes!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Use cut to compare climate data across decades.</code></pre>
<p>Next, it’s time to get into dplyr! Many examples of good dplyr code
for working with climate data have been provided above. If you’re lost,
copy these examples over your region. This would be a good time to
consider using the anomalies calculated last week. Once you are
satisfied with your new data frame, plot it, and if it makes sense,
include a linear fit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔥 <strong>Important:</strong> Copy the code you use to simplify your
data so you can reuse it for future workshops. It will also be important
to record how you conducted your analysis!</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="r"><code># Use dplyr functions to simplify your climate data.</code></pre>

<div id="section-conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>That wraps up this week! Fewer exercises this week, but the intent is
for you to spend as much time as you can understanding and playing with
dplyr. For the following workshops it will be essential to manipulate
and simplify data frames. We will have one more workshop before
<strong>Assessment Portfolio Task A</strong> is due, where we will fully
introduce linear modelling, make sure you are making good progress on
your report. That’s all for now, great job!
